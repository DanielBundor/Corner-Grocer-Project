# Corner Grocer Item Tracker

## Project Summary
The Corner Grocer Item Tracker is a C++ program designed to analyze text records generated by the Corner Grocer throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. The program provides functionality to search for specific items, print the frequency of all items purchased, print a histogram representing the frequency of items, and save the frequency data to a backup file.

## Functional Requirements
- **Menu Option One:** Search for a specific item and return its frequency.
- **Menu Option Two:** Print the frequency of all items.
- **Menu Option Three:** Print a histogram representing the frequency of items.
- **Menu Option Four:** Exit the program.
- **Data File Creation:** Automatically create a backup file with the frequency data.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Select the desired option from the menu:
   - Option 1: Search for a specific item.
   - Option 2: Print the frequency of all items.
   - Option 3: Print a histogram.
   - Option 4: Exit the program.
